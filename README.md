# Bone-Fracture-Detection-

An AI-powered web application that detects bone fractures from X-ray images using **TensorFlow**, **ResNet50**, and **Flask**. The system first identifies the body part (Elbow, Hand, or Shoulder) and then predicts whether the bone is **Fractured** or **Normal**.

## 🧠 Working

The application performs prediction in two stages:

### Step 1: Body Part Classification

The uploaded X-ray image is classified into one of the following:

- Elbow
- Hand
- Shoulder

### Step 2: Fracture Detection

After identifying the body part, the corresponding trained ResNet50 model predicts whether the image is:

- Fractured
- Normal

The final diagnosis is displayed on the web interface.
